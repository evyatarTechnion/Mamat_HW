1. There are 20 teams in the Premier League, each team have a squad of about 30 players. 
We assume that it takes about a minute to look for 'midfielder' keyword in a players web page,
so the time it takes for only one team is 30 minutes, and 10 hours for all Premier League's teams.

2. We understood that writing a script to serach for patterns in files/web pages can easily decrease the time the task takes,
and that the result will be more precise.
This method can be applied in various tasks, such as, search for Errors in log files, search for a circular trip route in a trip web page, etc.

3. We can run the script manually every hour by the command ./scrape_players.sh,
and we can make it easier.
One option for running it every hour automatically is to use: 

while true; do
	...my_script...
	sleep 3600;
done

this while loop will run the script every 3600 seconds (1 hour).
We can overwrite the output files so we dont have problem with palyers that are still exist and already scanned by our code in privious runs.
Another option is to make uniqe output file for every run, e.g. named it with the time info.
